### Proof

The aim will be to show that $f'(a) \leq 0$ and $f'(a) \geq 0$.

Assuming that $f$ is differentiable in $a$, then by the [[Differentiability on R|definition of differentiability]] we have that 
$$\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} = f'(a)$$
Since $a$ is an inner point in $a$, it must be a
