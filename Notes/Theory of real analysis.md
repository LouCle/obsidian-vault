## Standard theory

### Limits


### Continuity

**Definition.** [[Continuity on R]].

**Theorem.** [[Extreme Value Theorem]].

**Theorem.** [[Intermediate Value Theorem]].

**Corollary.** Image of interval on continuous function is interval.

**Theorem.** A continuous and strictly increasing function $f: I \subset \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ has a continuous and strictly increasing preimage $f^{-1} : J = f(I) \to I$.

**Definition.** [[Uniform Continuity on R]].

**Theorem.** [[Uniform Continuity on Intervals]].

**Theorem.** Let $f: (a,b) \to \mathbb R$ be a real function on an open, bounded interval. Then there exists a continuous function $g:[a,b] \to \mathbb R$ with $g(x)=f(x)$ for all $x\in (a,b)$ if and only if $f$ is uniformly continuous.

**Theorem.** [[Nested Interval Theorem]].

### Differentiability

**Definition.** [[Differentiability on R]] 

## Techniques

### General

**Technique.** It's very often easier to show that a construction $x=y$ by proving that $x\geq y$ and $x\leq y$.

**Technique.** It's often useful to play around with quantities in the triangle inequality.

### Limits

**Technique.** Try dividing limits into their single-limits to exploit certain properties. 

See for example the proof that the [[Derivative at Maximum is Zero|derivative at maximum is zero]].

### Uniform continuity

**Technique.** If we are to prove uniform continuity on a domain, it's sometimes easier to prove it on sub-intervals of the domain.

See the proof that [[Continuous Function with Infinite Limits is Uniformly Continuous|continuous function with infinite limits is uniformly continuous]].
