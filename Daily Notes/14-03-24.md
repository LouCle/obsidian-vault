##### Todo
- [ ] Add a proof for Taylor's Remainder Theorem
- [ ] Do Analysis 0 homework set 3 (not obligatory, but would like it done before Mar 19)
- [ ] Understand how matrix multiplication works as spans in $\mathbf{FinSet}$ 
- [ ] Add examples to integration by parts and substitution
- [ ] Add the "box" integration technique to [[Theory of real analysis]]
- [ ] Finish especially proofs to uniqueness of Riemann integral and FTC 1 and 2.

##### Daily musings
- Gonna write some proofs, probably for uniqueness of RI and FTC 2
- First I'll just add a little page on tagged partitions and mesh size.
