- [ ] Add a proof for Taylor's Remainder Theorem

##### Daily musings
- Reading about Taylor's Remainder Theorem. There's a lot of details to be wary of. 
- The proof uses the Extended Rolle's Theorem (as I've described in these notes). That theorem is different than the one I can find online with the same name. I figured I would refer to mine as ERT 1 and the other one as ERT 2. Though I haven't added the other one yet, and I found that the other one is quite trivial as well.
- There are several forms of the Taylor's Remainder Theorem, albeit equivalent. My notes use the Lagrange form which is also the one from my book. There are supposedly around 18 conventional forms used to express the remainder. 
- The Lagrange form is non-constructive in some sense, as it only qualifies the existence of a point $\xi$ on an interval, whereas a common form might be to express the remainder as the integral $$R_n(b)=\frac{1}{(n-1)!}\int_a^b f^{(n)}(t)(b-t)^{n-1}~dt$$Admittedly I don't know where that form comes from. I'm also not entirely sure about the constant to the left of the integral, as the formula I can find on Wikipedia doesn't include such a constant.
- I also realised just now that I didn't grasp $O$-notation, and I will have to learn it now.
