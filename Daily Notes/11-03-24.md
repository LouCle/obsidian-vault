##### Daily musings
- Wrote a ton of theorems and proofs on the differentiability on $\mathbb R$. 
- Will soon be finished with chapter 4 in the Analysis 0 book. At the current pace I will quickly be back on schedule.
- Chapter 5 is about the Riemann integral, anti-derivatives and vector integration, so it is very important to cover as much ground as possible before then.
- I was pretty happy to see the original proofs for MVT and Rolle's theorem, and I felt that I could prove them just from the hint in the text. The use of the auxiliary function for the proof of the MVT is a nice technique. I wonder if we could apply this somewhere else i.e. if supplied with a property $P$ pertaining to a subset of functions, and then take any $f$, create a function $g$ from $f$ for which $P$ holds, in the hopes of obtaining a property $Q$ which holds for all $f$.
