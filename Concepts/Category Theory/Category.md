### Topics in Category Theory

**Concept.** [[Universal property]].
### Examples

**Example.** The elements of a partially ordered set together with its order forms a category.

**Example.** The category of $\mathbf{Set}$ where the objects are sets and the morphisms are maps.

**Example.** The categories of $\mathbf{Vect},~\mathbf{Grp},~\mathbf{Rng}$ and so on, where the objects are algebraic structures and the maps are their respective homomorphisms.

**Example.** A groupoid is a category where every morphism is an isomorphism.
