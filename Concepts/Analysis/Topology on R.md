### Theory

**Definition.** An *open interval* is an interval of the sort $(a,b)$.

**Definition.** A *closed set* $S$ on $\mathbb R$ has that $S^c$ is an open ball.

The kinds of intervals that are closed on $\mathbb R$ are $[a,b]$, $(-\infty, a]$ and $[a,\infty)$. There are of course plenty of closed sets which are not intervals.

**Definition.**  A point $x\in \mathbb R^n$ is a *closure point* for a set $A \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ if every open ball $B_\epsilon(x)$ around $x$ contains at least one point from $A$ i.e. 
$$B_\epsilon(x)\cap A \neq \emptyset$$ for all $\epsilon>0$.

**Definition.** The set $\bar A=\mathrm{cl}~A$ of closure points is the *closure* of $A$. 

**Definition.** A *limit point* or *accumulation point* is a point in the derived set $A'=\bar A - A$.

**Theorem.** A set ${} A$ is equal to its closure $\bar A$ if and only if $A$ is a closed set.
